           <h2 id="ram"> RAM </h2> 
             <p id="ramp">RAM stands for Random Acess Memory. What it does is it stores temporary things. When you shut your computer off the information
      will be gone. Data is stored randomly across the board rather then in sequence. It can be transferred at random to the processer.</p>

       <p id="cputext"> CPU stands for "Central Processing Unit". The CPU is very important because it is what processes the information and commands. It basically
       handles all the instructions you give to your computer. Everything goes through the CPU. Even simple actions like pressing keys on the 
       keyboard go through the CPU. </p>
