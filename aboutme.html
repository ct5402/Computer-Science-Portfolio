     <p> My name is Chloe nd I am currently a sophmore at Everest Public High School. I'm 15 years old and my birthday is April 13.
       I have one sister and 2 dogs a pug named Maggie and a sharpei named Rosie.I really like watching movies and it is one of my favorite 
       things to do in my free-time. My two favorite movies are <strong> Edward Scissorhands </strong> and <strong>Pretty in Pink</strong>. 
       I really like Edward Scissorhands because I like the plot of the movie and I have been watching it since I was 10 years old. The first time
       I wathced it became my favorite movie. My second favorite movie is Pretty in Pink. I really enjoy watching this movie because it takes
       place in the 80s. Its also a cute plot although I don't really like the ending.</p>
       <h2> Hobbies</h2>
     <p>I do not have many diffrent hobbies. Some of my hobbies include yoga, walking my dog, and reading books. My favoriite book genre to reaad
     is historical fiction because I think its intresting to see things from a different perspective. I like to take my dog on a walk because I think
     its funny to see her interact with the plants and everything around her. I also like to walk to just to exercise. I have a collection of stuffed food
     with faces. I collect them because I think they are adorable and they are so soft!</p>
