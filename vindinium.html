        <h2> Vindinium </h2>
        <h3>What is Vindinium?</h3>
        <p>Vindinium is a game where people program their own bots. 
        The goal of the game is to have the most gold, gold is collected by having mines. 
        You compete against 3 other bots also programmed by someone. The tavern is used to recharge health, 
        the mines are guarded by goblins and are where the gold comes from.
        If you kill another player you automatically take control of their mines. 
        You can endlessly be respawned however each time you will start out with 0 mines.

        <h3>What My Bot Does</h3>
        <p>My bot can go to taverns to double drink, claim free mines and also attack the player with the most amount of mines. 
        In order to go to the tavern, I created an if statement which determines that the bot will go to the tavern when 
        the health is below 49. This then sets the task to lowHealth leading to another if statement. 
        The lowHealth if statement brings the bot to the closest tavern. This is done by using a for loop 
        which determines the x and y coordinates of each tavern on the map. 
        It then compares each location of the tavern and how close it is to my bots position on the map.</p>
        <p>The second thing my bot can do is claim free mines. This was also done using an if else statement.
        If the bots health is above 80 it will claim any free mines available. 
        The code is very similar to the tavern code, a for loop is used in order to find the position of the closest mine.</p>
        <p>The third thing my bot is able to do is attack the player with the highest amount of gold. 
        This was the most challenging thing for me to do. At first when coding this I thought I had 
        to use math.max to find the highest bot with the highest mines. This was incorrect because 
        by finding the bot with the highest amount of mines I was not finding the x and y coordinates 
        of the bots to fight. I programmed my bot starting with an if statement which states if the bots 
        life is between 70 and 100 the task will be set to attack. This then lead to another if 
        statement and inside it , it has a for loop which compares the mine counts of all the enemy bots. 
</p>
<p>The final thing my bot can do is double drink from the tavern. This means that my bot is able to recieve double
the health and fill its health bar to 100.In order to get my bot to double drink I had to create an if statement
at the beginning of the code which determined that after the first 5 turns in the game my bot should not go to the
tavern and bot.drink = false. However after the first 5 turns bot.drink = true which means it can drink again. 
</p>
<h3>What I Learned About AI</h3>
<p>I thought it was stressful to create my bot. It did not always do what I wanted it to do. 
The code sometimes got complicated because of the if else tree and I got confused on how to use 
it sometimes.  Overall I think my opinion has changed a lot about AI because I never knew how complicated it could be. 
I think AI is really cool and can be really useful in the right situations.</p>
