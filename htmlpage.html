    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for<span class="html"> H</span>yper<span class="html">T</span>ext <span class="html">M</span>arkup <span class="html">
        L</span>anguage. It is usally used to create websites. Your are able to place images, link pages on the website, link other websites, and finally place simple headings and titles. HTML was invented in 1990 by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>.
        He was working at CERN a place where scientist meet and discuss things, he was trying to think of something where scientist and researchers were able to collabarate together. He then came up with the idea of the World Wide Web! HTML was created
        for a way to allow people to create their own websites. Although without CSS HTML is not very pleasing to the eye!</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for <span class="html">C</span>ascading <span class="html">S</span>tyle
        <span class="html">S</span>heets. CSS is what is used to style HTML and other markup languages.CSS and HTML both use tags but CSS tags are mainly used to style things and organize them.CSS was not released the same time HTML was because at first
        HTML was created to share your ideas not really show your creativity.People then started to complain that they didn't have enough influence over their webpage and how it look so people thought of the idea of CSS, a way to style their website to
        their liking. I think its something very important to use while using HTML because it allows you to give your website personality. CSS allows to better organize HTML and making it look cooler.

    <h2>Tags & Attributes</h2>
    <p> A tag is a piece of code used to identify the start or end of an element. The element starts at the first tag and ends at the last tag. A tag is written using angled brackets and inbetween those is a command which is part of the tag. The tag creates
        the element and the attribute modifies it. The attribute describes the tag and how it will be displayed. The tag goes through the web browser which reads the HTML and then displays it on the screen.
        <h2>Examples of Tags</h2>
