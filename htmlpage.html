       <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for<span class="html"> H</span>yper<span class="html">T</span>ext <span class="html">M</span>arkup <span class="html">
        L</span>anguage. It is usally used to create websites. Your are able to place images, link pages on the website, link other websites,
        and finally place simple headings and titles. HTML was invented in 1990 by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>. He was working at CERN a place where
        scientist meet and discuss things, he was trying to think of something where scientist and researchers were able to collabarate together. He then
        came up with the idea of the World Wide Web! HTML was created for a way to allow people to create their own websites. Although without
        CSS HTML is not very pleasing to the eye!</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for <span class="html">C</span>ascading <span class="html">S</span>tyle
        <span class="html">S</span>heets. CSS is what is used to style HTML and other markup languages.CSS and HTML both use tags but CSS tags are mainly used to style things and organize them.CSS was not released the same time HTML was because at first HTML was created
        to share your ideas not really show your creativity.People then started to complain that they didn't have enough influence over their
        webpage and how it look so people thought of the idea of CSS, a way to style their website to their liking. I think its something very important to use while using HTML because it allows you to give your website 
        personality. CSS allows to better organize HTML and making it look
        cooler.</p>
        <h2>All about Tags!</h2>
        <p>Tags are what are used in order to tell the program what to do and where to put things. You place your command inbetween two angled brackets
